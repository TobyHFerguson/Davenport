GUI menu options will be shown connected by arrows, thus: Top -> Child1 -> Child2 -> Leaf.


* Current Environment
* Setup
The following steps need to be taken once, to allow the browser to access the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) GUI, and to prepare the OEM environment for Bare Metal Provisioning (BMP).

Accessing OEM is through the OEM URL: =https://HOST:17802/em= where =HOST= is the (resolvable) hostname or ip address of the host machine. (It is assumed that the local firewall permits port 17802 to be accessed).
** Browser Certificates
Connect to the OEM URL. Your browser will likely show a security exception (the image below is shown using Firefox 31.2.0):

Click on the lower yellow triangle to expose the 'Add Exception...' button:

Add the exception by clicking the 'Add Exception...' button:

#+LaTeX: \clearpage
And then clicking the 'Confirm Security Exception' button. This will then take you to the OEM login window:

** Oracle Enterprise Manager GUI setup
Login to OEM by accessing the OEM URL and using the name/password pair of 'sysman/Welcome1'. This will show you an 'Accessibility Preferences' page (this is *not* actually the page you'll first see! However the initial page is very similar, so hopefully this image is sufficient!):
#+CAPTION: Accessibility Preferences
[[file:images/Accessibility_Preference.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
Select the preferences for you (if any), and then OK. Your preferences are now set up and you will be taken to the 'OEM Welcome' Screen:

#+LaTeX: \clearpage
 (If you need to change these preferences you can do so using the menu Sysman -> Accessibility option)
