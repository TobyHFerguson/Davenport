#+TITLE: Bare Metal Provisioning with Oracle Enteprise Manager
* Overview
* Current Environment
* Setup
The following steps need to be taken once, to allow the browser to access the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) GUI, and to prepare the OEM environment for Bare Metal Provisioning (BMP).

Accessing OEM is through the OEM URL: =https://HOST:17802/em= where =HOST= is the (resolvable) hostname or ip address of the host machine. (It is assumed that the local firewall permits port 17802 to be accessed).
** Browser Certificates
Connect to the OEM URL. Your browser will likely show a security exception (the image below is shown using Firefox 31.2.0):

And then clicking the 'Confirm Security Exception' button. This will then take you to the OEM login window:
