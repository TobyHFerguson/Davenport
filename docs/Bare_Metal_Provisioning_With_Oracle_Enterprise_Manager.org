#+TITLE: Bare Metal Provisioning with Oracle Enteprise Manager
* Overview
* Conventions used in this document
Text to be typed in is shown in this face: =type me in=

GUI menu options will be shown connected by arrows, thus: Top -> Child1 -> Child2 -> Leaf.


* Current Environment
* Setup
The following steps need to be taken once, to allow the browser to access the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) GUI, and to prepare the OEM environment for Bare Metal Provisioning (BMP).

Accessing OEM is through the OEM URL: =https://HOST:17802/em= where =HOST= is the (resolvable) hostname or ip address of the host machine. (It is assumed that the local firewall permits port 17802 to be accessed).
** Browser Certificates
Connect to the OEM URL. Your browser will likely show a security exception (the image below is shown using Firefox 31.2.0):
#+CAPTION: Initial Untrusted Certificate Screen
[[file:images/Browser_Certificate_1.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
Click on the lower yellow triangle to expose the 'Add Exception...' button:
#+CAPTION: Untrusted Connection showing 'Add Exception...' Button
[[file:images/Browser_Certificate_2.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
Add the exception by clicking the 'Add Exception...' button:
#+CAPTION: Add Security Exception
[[file:images/Browser_Certificate_3.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
And then clicking the 'Confirm Security Exception' button. This will then take you to the OEM login window:
#+CAPTION: OEM Login
[[file:images/Screenshot-Login-OracleEnterpriseManager-MozillaFirefox.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
** Oracle Enterprise Manager GUI setup
Login to OEM by accessing the OEM URL and using the name/password pair of 'sysman/Welcome1'. This will show you an 'Accessibility Preferences' page (this is *not* actually the page you'll first see! However the initial page is very similar, so hopefully this image is sufficient!):
#+CAPTION: Accessibility Preferences
[[file:images/Accessibility_Preference.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
Select the preferences for you (if any), and then OK. Your preferences are now set up and you will be taken to the 'OEM Welcome' Screen:
#+CAPTION: OEM Welcome Screen
[[file:images/OEM_Welcome_Screen.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
 (If you need to change these preferences you can do so using the menu Sysman -> Accessibility option)
#+CAPTION: OEM Change Accessibility Menu
 [[file:images/OEM_Change_Accessibility.png]]
#+LaTeX: \clearpage
** Software Library
Bare Metal Provisioning, when run using the GUI (it can be run using the command line too), requires that at least two components be setup in the Software Library. These two components are an Operating System Component, and a Disk Component. These components will be referenced later during specific executions of BMP.

Use menu option Enterprise -> Provisioning and Patching -> Software Library to access the Software library:
#+CAPTION: OEM Software Library Access
[[file:images/OEM_Software_Library_Access.png]]

This will take you to the Software Library:
#+CAPTION: OEM Software Library
[[./images/Software_Library_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

*** Operating System Component
To create an Operating System Component right click on the 'Components' line in the Software Library, and select the 'Create Entity -> Bare Metal Provisioning' menu option:
#+CAPTION: Bare Metal Provisioning Menu Option
[[./images/Software_Library_BMP_Menu.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

This will provide a Create Entity pop-up showing the 'Operating System' to be created:
#+CAPTION: Create Entity (Operating System) pop-up
[[./images/Create_Entity_BMP_OS.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Select 'Continue', and you'll be taken to Step 1 (of 4) of the 'Create Operating System' wizard:
#+CAPTION: Create OS (Step 1)
[[./images/Create_OS_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Provide a name and (optional) description and hit 'Next' to get to Step 2. In Step 2 use the following settings:

| Item                  | Value         |
|-----------------------+---------------|
| Timezone              | Suit yourself |
| Root password         | vagrant       |
| Confirm Root Password | vagrant       | 

(OEM has already been configured with a Named Credential (ROOT_NC) with this user/password pair)

#+CAPTION: Create OS (Step 2)
[[./images/Create_OS_2.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
(Note - a user =oracle=, primary group =oinstall=, secondary group =dba= is automatically constructed by the BMP installer).

Hit 'OK' and 'Next' to move to Step 3:

#+CAPTION: Create OS (Step 3)
[[./images/Create_OS_3.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Set the following Enterprise Manager Agent Properties:
| Item                        | Value    |
|-----------------------------+----------|
| Install User                | oracle   |
| Install Group               | oinstall |
| Agent Registration Password | Welcome1 |

Change the Package List from =@everything= to
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
@base
nfs-utils
openssh-server
make
binutils
gcc
libaio
glibc-common
libstdc++
sysstat
#+END_EXAMPLE
The =@base= will make sure we install the minimal package set; the other packages are required to allow nfs to be used during the kickstart installation, to permit ssh access, and as requisites for a machine to host an OEM Agent.

Once the packages are installed some configuration is required. We do this in the 'post install' section, by adding the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
%post --log=/root/install.post.log
# Ensure that oracle can perform sudo actions with no password
echo 'oracle	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL' >/etc/sudoers.d/oracle
# Configure sudo for use by Enterprise Manager
sed -i -e '/requiretty$/s/^/#/' -e'/visiblepw$/s/!//'  /etc/sudoers
#+END_SRC
(Note that I log the post install actions so that I can trace errors later if necessary).
#+CAPTION: Postinstall Wizard
[[./images/Create_OS_3_Postinstall.png]]
The final Create OS Wizard screen should look like this:
#+CAPTION: Create OS (Step 3) With Properties Updated
[[./images/Create_OS_3_Updated.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Hit 'Next' to get to Step 4 (Review):
#+CAPTION: Create OS (Step 4)
[[./images/Create_OS_4.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Review the settings (you can go back and change them if you think you made a mistake). When satisfied hit 'Save and Upload' to save this component into the Software Library. 
#+CAPTION: Create OS Completed
[[./images/Create_OS_Completed.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
*** Disk Component
Create a Disk Component by right clicking on the 'Components' line in the Software Library and selecting the 'Create Entity -> Bare Metal Provisioning' menu option:
#+CAPTION: Bare Metal Provisioning Menu Option
[[./images/Software_Library_BMP_Menu.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

This will provide a Create Entity pop-up showing the 'Operating System' to be created. Change the selection to 'Disk Layout':
#+CAPTION: Create Entity (Disk Layout) pop-up
[[./images/Create_Entity_BMP_DL.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Hit 'Continue' to go to Step 1 (of 3) in the Create Disk Layout wizard.
#+CAPTION: Create Disk Layout (Step 1)
[[./images/Create_DL_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Provide a name and (optional) description and hit 'Next' to move to Step 2 of the Disk Layout wizard:
#+CAPTION: Create Disk Layout (Step 2)
[[./images/Create_DL_2.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Add a Disk Profile by selecting the appropriate 'Add' button, and create a disk named =sda= with a size of 15360 MB (15GB):
#+CAPTION: Add New Hard Disk Profile
[[./images/Add_New_Hard_Disk_Profile.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Add three partitions using the 'Add' button under 'Partition Configuration', configured thus:

| Device Name | File System Type | Mount Point | Grow  | Size (MB) |
|-------------+------------------+-------------+-------+-----------|
| /dev/sda0   | ext3             | /boot       | false | 200       |
| /dev/sda1   | swap             | swap        | false | 1024      |
| /dev/sda2   | ext3             | /           | true  | 1         | 
#+CAPTION: Partition Configuration
[[./images/Partition_Configuration.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

More complex disk layouts are possible, but for simplicity's sake we'll go with this basic layout. Select 'Next' to move to Step 3 of the Disk Layout wizard. Expanding the 'Configure' subsection will show the configuration that has been completed so far. Review it, go back to make changes if necessary:
#+CAPTION: Create Disk Layout (Step 3)
[[./images/Create_DL_3.png]]  
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Select 'Save and Upload' to be taken back to the Software Library:
#+CAPTION: Create Disk Layout Component Completed
[[./images/Create_DL_Completed.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
** Bare Metal Provisioning Infrastructure
Access the Bare Metal Provisioning wizard by selecting the Enterprise -> Provisioning and Patching -> Bare Metal Provisioning menu option:
#+CAPTION: Bare Metal Provisioning Menu Option:
[[./images/BMP_Menu_Option.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
This will take you to the initial BMP screen:
#+CAPTION: BMP Initial Screen
[[./images/BMP_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
As indicated on that initial page no BMP can occur because one or more parts of the infrastructure have not been configured. 
Select the 'Infrastructure' tab to begin the setup:
#+CAPTION: Infrastructure Wizard
[[./images/Infra_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Add a Stage Server by selecting the appropriate 'Add' button to open up the 'Add Stage Server' wizard:
#+CAPTION: 
[[./images/Server_Add_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Select the stage server by clicking on the magnifying glass on the right and then using the Select Targets wizard[fn:1: Alternatively, for the Stage Directory property, by selecting the magnifying glass on the 'Stage Directory' line you can open up the 'Remote File Browser' and thus select the directory using a wizard]:
#+CAPTION: Stage Server Selection
[[./images/Stage_server_selection.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

This will bring you back to the 'Add Stage Server' wizard. Add the next two propeties manually:

| Property        | Value                      |
|-----------------+----------------------------|
| Stage Directory | /stage                     |
| Base URL        | file://stage.lab.net/stage |

It is very important to get these values correct. Be careful and check your work. A failure to get these values correct isn't easy to figure out later!

Add a Boot server similarly. The property values required are:

| Property            | Value        |
|---------------------+--------------|
| Boot server         | tftp.lab.net |
| TFTP Boot Directory | /tftpboot    |

Again, check these values carefully!

We won't be using OEM to modify a DHCP server, so we don't configure one (its optional).

Add an RPM Repository, using the following property values:

| Property        | Value                  |
|-----------------+------------------------|
| Repository Name | OL6 Repository         |
| Complete URL    | http://yum.lab.net/ol6 |

When this process is completed the infrastructure page (with the 'Stage Server' expanded) should look like this:
#+CAPTION: Infrastructure Setup Review
[[./images/Infra_review.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Returning to the 'Deployments' tab will finalize this setup and the previous warning will no longer be shown:
#+CAPTION: Infrastructure Setup Completed
[[./images/Infra_Complete.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
** Snapshot
At this point it is good to perform a snapshot. This snapshot provides a recovery point that can be used as the start of all subsequent demos. It is important for an active system such as this to have a stable recovery point, and hence the need to halt all the VMs before taking the snapshot. This will ensure that restoring this recovery point will push all servers and services through an active reboot process, ensuring all ports are properly opened and bound etc. etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vagrant halt
vagrant snap take --name 'Setup Complete'
vagrant up
#+END_SRC

* Demo Operation
Navigate to the Bare Metal Provisioning wizard (Enterprise -> Provisioning and Patching -> Bare Metal Provisioning) and ensure the 'Deployments' tab is selected.
** Create the server to be provisioned
Execute the 'createBMP.sh' script to automatically make a VirtualBox VM (BMP) to be provisioned. 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
[toby@dell-server-2 Davenport]$ ./createBMP.sh
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Virtual machine 'BMP' is created and registered.
UUID: df6c3d90-411b-453d-b791-8ea1769b5971
Settings file: '/net/qnap1/VirtualBox/BMP/BMP.vbox'
0%...10%...20%...30%...40%...50%...60%...70%...80%...90%...100%
Disk image created. UUID: 2a267e92-7ab2-4309-a4f6-a85ed3497187

BMP's MAC Address: 08:00:27:4A:F8:9E
#+END_SRC
The MAC Address (in this case =08:00:27:4A:F8:9E=) will be needed during the next operation.
** Deploy an OS for provisioning
Select the 'Provision' item in the Bare Metal Provisioning wizard, and choose 'Operating System'[fn:2: we will save this as a plan and, on subsequent operations, one can choose 'Using Saved Plan', which saves some keystrokes. However to do so requires that any previous deployments using the same plan name be removed, or the plan name to be changed]. This will take us to the Provision Operating System wizard, Step 1 of 8. Provide a simple name for this deployment, choose the correct OS type  and add the MAC address for the BMP machine that we got when we created the VM using =createBMP.sh=. The result should look something like this:
#+CAPTION: Provision Operating System (Step 1)
[[./images/POS_1.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Select 'Next' to move to Step 2. Most of the fields are already filled out[fn:3: selecting the =Run Boot Server Pre-requisite checks' checkbox will cause a failure downstream: this check checks for a package that is no longer used], but you'll need to fill in the OS Component and Disk Layout Component configuration properties using the 'Search and Select: Entities' wizards available by selecting the appropriate magnifying glasses[fn:3: Note that if one has multiple versions of an entity the entities are sorted in ascending version number: the latest version is lowest in the wizard's entity table]. The end result should look something like:
#+CAPTION: Provision Operating System (Step 2)
[[./images/POS_2.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage

Select 'Next' to move through subsequent steps. All of them have been pre-filled by the components we configured earlier. At Step 8 select 'Save As Plan' and provide a suitable name (I use 'OL6') - this will enable the current selections to be reused directly next time around. Then hit submit. A job will be submitted and the deployment will be provisioned in the background:
#+CAPTION: BMP Confirmation
[[./images/BMP_Confirmation.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Follow the link just under the confirmation window to see the procedure activity (you might like to change the 'View Data' item on the right hand side to 'Real Time: 30 second refresh' to get automatically update this screen to show what's going on. If all is successful you should get to this point:
#+CAPTION: BMP Procedure Activity
[[./images/BMP_Procedure_Activity.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
This means the tftp and stage server have been successfuly configured to PXE boot a server with the given MAC address, and thus to install on OS on that server.
** Provision the server via PXE boot
Either use the VirtualBox GUI to start the BMP VM, or start it up on the command line:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
vboxmanage startvm BMP
#+END_SRC
You should see the VM go through a PXE boot and then start installing the OS according to the specifications laid out in the Operating System and Disk Layout components
** Re-provisioning
If you wish to go through the PXE boot process again then you need to do two things:
+ Delete the BMP server and agent from Enterprise Manager
+ Replace the BMP server's system disk and reboot
Both of these actions can be accomplished by simply running =createBMP= a second time - the script will detect that a BMP server already exists and will execute the above actions.

However, should you wish to execute these tasks manually, the following section describes how to do it:
*** Delete the BMP server from Enterprise Manager
Select the menu option 'Targets -> All targets' to list all the targets:
#+CAPTION: Selecting All Targets menu option:
[[./images/all_targets.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Select the =bmp.lab.net:3872' link:
#+CAPTION: Selecting the 'bmp.lab.net:3872' link
[[./images/bmp_link.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
This will take you to the bmp agent page:
#+CAPTION: BMP Agent
[[./images/bmp_agent.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Select the 'Agent -> Target Setup -> Agent Decommision' menu item to start the agent decommission process:
#+CAPTION: Agent Decommission Menu Selection
[[./images/agent_decomission.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
This will popup a confirmation:
#+CAPTION: Agent Decommission Agent Down Confirmation
[[./images/agent_decommission_popup.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Ignore the content of this popup and Press 'Continue' (because we're going to completely remove the host and the agent we don't need to stop the agent as requested by the popup). That'll take us to a list of monitored targets:
#+CAPTION: Agent Decommision Targets List
[[./images/agent_decommission_targets.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
Hit 'Continue' in the top right corner. This will take you to a confirmation popup:
#+CAPTION: Agent Decommission Target Delete Confirmation
[[./images/agent_decommission_confirmation_popup.png]]
Accept the popup and you'll return to the 'All Targets' screen, with the =bmp= and =bmp:3872= links deleted:
#+CAPTION: All Targets After Deleting BMP Agent
[[./images/all_targets_no_bmp.png]]
#+LATEX: \clearpage
*** Swap the disks and reboot the BMP server
This can be done via the VirtualBox GUI:
- stop the server
- remove the disk from the server
- remove and delete the disk from the media manager's list of disks (and thus the underlying file systems)
- add a new disk to the server
- reboot the server

Alternatively simply use the =rebootBMP.sh= to perform this operation.
